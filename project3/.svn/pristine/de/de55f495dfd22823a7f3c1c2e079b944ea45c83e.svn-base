function D=l2distance(X,Z)
	
Computes the Euclidean distance matrix. 
Syntax:
D=l2distance(X,Z)
Input:
X: dxn data matrix with n vectors (columns) of dimensionality d
Z: dxm data matrix with m vectors (columns) of dimensionality d

Output:
Matrix D of size nxm 
D(i,j) is the Euclidean distance of X(:,i) and Z(:,j)
